# Dataset downloaded from - https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic
The dataset consists of Train.csv and Test.csv
Train.csv will contain the details of a subset of the passengers on board (891 to be exact) and importantly, will reveal whether they survived or not, also known as the “ground truth”.
The test.csv dataset contains similar information but does not disclose the “ground truth” for each passenger.
